    "abstract":"Continuous directed evolution techniques leverage error-prone replication machinery for rapid in vivo mutagenesis of target genes. However, promiscuous activity by error-prone machinery can lead to damage of the host genome.\nHere, we propose an orthogonal replication system, DiversiPhi29, for the continuous directed evolution of genes in vivo in a bacterial chassis. This system leverages the well-studied bacteriophage \u03a629 and E. coli. In this project, we first attempt to modify four \u03a629 proteins to enable the heterologous replication of a linear construct consisting of a single gene-of-interest and origin sequences. Once orthogonal replication is established, we will implement a system capable of tuning the mutation rate of the linear construct\u2019s replication by altering the ratio of two \u03a629 DNA polymerases, one of which contains fidelity-reducing mutations. This approach will enable high throughput molecular evolution in the best understood model organism.",

    "abstract":"Excessive cadmium accumulation has been a long-term crucial problem which affects the production of crops and health. Consumption of cadmium-containing rice forces cells to accumulate a large amount of cadmium, and then brings damage to kidneys. OsNramp5 is the main transporter for rice to absorb Mn2+, but it also absorbs Cd2+. Current modification on OsNramp5 managed to reduce the absorption of Cd2+ at the cost of lack of Mn2+. Therefore, we tried to obtain a mutant through directed evolution. Error-prone PCR was used to construct a gene mutation library of OsNramp5 and then we obtained 4 strains with expected phenotype. Finally, the homology modeling was conducted through SWISS-MODEL. We searched the related papers and compared with the structure of channel proteins of the same family that had been analyzed to find the possible catalytic site which provide theoretical basis for rational design of OsNramp5. We hope that the protein to  evolute could be used in the cultivation of low-cadmium rice and eventually be applied in field production to obtain healthful crops.",

In addition, multiple gRNAs-guided EvolvR system is of great application value.

In this study, we aimed to develop an allosteric transcription factors (aTFs) based biosensor for HMA. PobR, an aTF for HMA analog 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, was used to alter its selectivity and create novel aTFs responsive to HMA by directed evolution. We established a PobR mutant library with a capacity of 550,000 clones using error-prone PCR and Megawhop PCR. Through our screening, two mutants were obtained with responsiveness to HMA. Analysis of each missense mutation indicating residues 122-126 were involved in its PobR ligand specificity. Then the strain with HMA biosensor and HMA synthetic module was evolved with a 600-fold increase in genome mutation rate. After successive rounds of evolution, HMA titer reached 8.4 mg\/L with a 4.5-fold increase. These results showed the effectiveness of directed evolution in switching the ligand specificity of a biosensor and improving HMA production.",

In recent decade, distributed AI models have been widely deployed to accelerate the R & D cycle (Research and Development Cycle) and reduce costs in multiple stages, yet the cost of drug development still increases annually resulting from the expensive computation processes.\nThe recent release of Alphafold2 by DeepMind, however, brings some new insight into these long-lasting complicated problems. Inspired by its power to predict protein structures efficiently and accurately, we combined protein-peptide complex structure prediction and in silico directed evolution and developed Peplib Generator, which allowed us to generate optimized peptide ligands from target protein information in one step. \nPeplib Generator has the following 2 parts: a peptide sequence generator and optimization network, and a gradient evaluation network powered by turbo-AlphaFold2. Given the target pocket information and expected properties, Peplib Generator can quickly and finely generate multiple new potential peptide binders for the pocket, achieving the goal of one-step generation of sequence library.",

Herein, the catalytic activities of BmmGT1 towards sugar acceptors was enhanced via directed evolution. A small library of variant BmmGT1 with mutated binding sites mutants were generated and screened using a 3-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin-based ultraviolet spectrophotometry screening method. Two mutants (M79F and M79W) were obtained, showing ~2.1-fold higher glucosylation activities towards 3-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin than the wild-type BmmGT1. Their catalytic activities towards other sugar acceptors were further tested, and the glucosylation activities of M79W was identified with ~3.6-fold and ~1.2-fold increase towards MLN A and piericidin A, respectively.

Sequence Saturation Mutagenesis is a random mutagenesis method which has been successfully optimised in this study, resulting in a 5-fold increase in DNA yields, enhancing subsequent library generation. Moreover, the need for expensive phosphorothioate nucleotides has been made redundant by incorporating a novel shearing method using sonication, allowing for greater accessibility to this directed evolution technique for future studies. Additionally, a library was successfully designed using the GeneORator method, in which secondary shell active site residues were targeted with the degenerate NNK codon. Preliminary high-throughput screening suggests active variants are present, however, further sequencing and kinetic studies are required.",

We introduced molecular dynamic simulation on thermodynamic properties of MnP. The influence of amino acid residues, secondary structures and salt bridge alterations on MnP thermostability were analyzed, the results of which were used to construct our MnP\u2019s single-point-mutation library (342 samples in total). Subsequently, we built a multi-functional enzyme library and rectified the calculated free energy of the aforementioned single-point mutations, thereby improving the reliability of our data. In addition, we expressed and purified four MnP mutants in Pichia pastoris, and evaluated their improvements in stability and activity compared to the original MnP. Finally, mutant 8# showed a significant activity improvement under low pH condition, while mutant 7#\u2019s organic solvent stability was remarkably improved.",

    "abstract":"Quorum sensing (QS) allows bacteria to communicate by regulating gene expression in response to population cell density. Cell density is indicated by the concentration of diffusible autoinducer molecules produced within cells. Population-wide gene regulation is widely attractive for synthetic biology circuits to link cell-to-cell communication with decision making.\nThe Gram-negative quorum sensing system relies on N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) as autoinducer molecules. Transcription regulators that bind to specific AHLs control downstream expression of genes in response to the concentration of the AHL. A key bottleneck in using quorum sensing parts to build complex genetic circuits is orthogonality between transcription regulators, either caused by non-specific binding to AHLs or non-specific binding to promoters. To address this, we designed an experimental pipeline for the directed evolution of quorum sensing transcription regulators to respond to non-cognate AHL molecules, which would expand the toolbox to build orthogonal genetic circuits.\nOur protein of interest is the EsaR transcription regulator that has a rare dual activation\/repression function, which would be useful as a circuit switch by allowing linked activator-repressor motifs to be constructed more efficiently. We used bioinformatics tools to design a pipeline for the evolution of EsaR, using site-saturation mutagenesis to generate a library and ON\/OFF screening methods to select best performing variants. Although working with EsaR would have been preferred, we had to adapt our wet lab approach due to unforeseen circumstances and decided that working on the well-characterised homologue LuxR instead would still provide us with informative conclusions about our pipeline design whilst gaining insight into the novel properties of LuxR mutants.\nWe used semi-rational directed evolution has been utilised to improve the orthogonality of these density-dependent systems, by altering key residues involved in the recognition of inducer molecules, thus changing receptor sensitivity to novel molecules. Further work must be conducted to optimise such methods, although directed evolution provides a promising avenue to engineer these bacterial transcription factors for broader applications in synthetic biology.",
